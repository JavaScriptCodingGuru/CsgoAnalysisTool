Project Goal:
	
		Create a csgo analyitc tool that takes the pain out of looking through your demos(demos suck)
	so that you can improve you decision making and game sense. I.E. grenades (where they land, how effective they are, and if
	there is a line up that could have been used to be more effective), deaths (where you die, how often, heatmap of location on map,
	what could have been done differently), positioning, etc. etc.
		In game replay for "teachable" moments, I.E. showing where a flash landed and the LOS of the flash and where you could have thrown it.
		In game practice tools: grenade lineups, taking sites, clearing angles.
